She also had some loss of sense of vibration and sense of proprioception peripherally. Moreover, there was a generalized hyporeflexia and gait examination showed a positive Romberg sign. On further inquiry, there was no previous history of similar symptoms or recent history of having any upper respiratory tract infection or diarrhea. There was no history of recent travel. Her current medications included losartan (50 mg) for her blood pressure control and the multi-vitamins.

Her birth weight was 3550 g (75th centile), her length was 53 cm (90th centile), and her OFC 36.5 cm (around 98th centile).

Audiometric and fundus oculi examinations were both normal. She reached head control at 3.5 months, sitting position at 10 months, and non-autonomous standing station at 15 months. Up to 15 months, she presented difficulties in handling objects with coarse grip. Language was poor with very few words developed at 13 months. Psychomotor delay was accompanied by macrocephaly: until 4 months of age, OFC was at the 98th centile and from 8 to 10 months it was abundantly above the 98th centile.

I've been having numbness and weakness in my extremities for a while now, along with some balance problems.\\nDoctor: How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?\\nPatient: It's been gradual, but it's been going on for a few weeks now.\\nDoctor: I see. During the neurological examination, we found that you had diffusely reduced muscle strength on the Medical Research Council muscle power grading scale, along with reduced perception to all modalities conducting either by dorsal column lemniscus or spinothalamic pathway. You also had some loss of sense of vibration and sense of proprioception peripherally. Did you notice any of these symptoms?\\nPatient: Yes, I did.

The probable diagnosis at this point is monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) related neuropathy.\\nPatient: What does that mean for me?\\nDoctor: We need to do more testing, including bone marrow biopsy, to confirm the diagnosis. However, it appears that the high IgM titers and anti-MAG antibody titers greater than 1:102400 are consistent with MGUS. The atypical cells found in your bone marrow biopsy were also consistent with this diagnosis.\\nPatient's family: Excuse me, doctor. What does this mean for our family member?\\nDoctor: I'm sorry to say that the prognosis for MGUS is not good.

        "\n",
        "This tool analyzes text conversations using various natural language processing (NLP) techniques to derive insights such as sentiment, emotion, tone, lexical diversity, readability, and more. It leverages several popular libraries like `spaCy`, `TextBlob`, `Hugging Face Transformers`, and `WordCloud` to perform the analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Features\n",
        "1. **Sentiment Analysis**:\n",
        "   - Detects whether the sentiment of the text is positive, neutral, or negative. This helps in understanding the emotional tone of the conversation.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Attention Level**:\n",
        "   - Determines the attention level based on the sentiment score. If the sentiment is more negative, the attention level is high, indicating potential concern or focus.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**:\n",
        "   - Extracts entities like names, dates, locations, and organizations from the text. This helps in understanding the key components mentioned in the conversation.\n",
        "   \n",
        "4. **Tone Detection**:\n",
        "   - Heuristically assigns a tone to the conversation based on sentiment labels. It can categorize the tone as \"Neutral\", \"Concerned\", or \"Reassuring\".\n",
        "   \n",
        "5. **Emotion Detection**:\n",
        "   - Uses a zero-shot classification model to detect emotions such as joy, anger, sadness, fear, or surprise based on the conversation's text.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Subjectivity**:\n",
        "   - Determines the subjectivity of the text. A higher subjectivity score indicates a more personal, opinion-based conversation, while a lower score indicates factual content.\n",
        "   \n",
        "7. **Polarity**:\n",
        "   - Measures how positive or negative the text is using the `TextBlob` polarity score. It ranges from -1 (negative) to 1 (positive).\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Lexical Diversity**:\n",
        "   - Calculates the proportion of unique words in the text to the total number of words, giving an indication of the text’s vocabulary richness.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Readability Score**:\n",
        "   - Computes the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, which helps assess how easy or difficult the text is to read. A higher score indicates more complex text.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Word Cloud Visualization**:\n",
        "   - Generates a visual representation of the most frequently occurring words in the text.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Requirements\n",

        "\n",
        "### 1. **Sentiment**\n",
        "   - **Value:** `{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.7883050441741943}`\n",
        "   - **Explanation:**\n",
        "     - The sentiment analysis determines whether the overall tone of the text is positive, negative, or neutral.\n",
        "     - In this case, the sentiment is labeled as *NEGATIVE* with a confidence score of `0.78` (78.8%).\n",
        "     - This is useful in medical case analysis to gauge the emotional weight of patient reports and understand the impact of their condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Attention Level**\n",
        "   - **Value:** `Low`\n",
        "   - **Explanation:**\n",
        "     - Indicates the level of engagement or focus in the text.\n",
        "     - In medical cases, a low attention level may suggest that the patient's condition is critical but lacks detailed engagement from the patient in therapy.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Tone**\n",
        "   - **Value:** `Concerned`\n",
        "   - **Explanation:**\n",
        "     - Identifies the overall emotional tone of the text, which helps in determining how the message is conveyed.\n",
        "     - In this case, the tone being \"concerned\" aligns with the serious nature of the medical condition described.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Entities**\n",
        "   - **Value:** `('77-year-old', 'DATE'), ('ICU', 'ORG'), ('COVID-19', 'ORG'), ('wean', 'NORP'), ('daily', 'DATE'), ('2 weeks', 'DATE'), ('One week', 'DATE'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('Two days later', 'DATE'), ('MRC', 'ORG'), ('40/60', 'CARDINAL'), ('22/50', 'CARDINAL')`\n",
        "   - **Explanation:**\n",
        "     - Named Entity Recognition (NER) identifies specific important terms in the text.\n",
        "     - These include:\n",
        "       - **Dates and durations** (e.g., \"2 weeks\", \"One week\") for tracking treatment progress.\n",
        "       - **Medical terms** (e.g., \"ICU\", \"COVID-19\") to classify patient conditions.\n",
        "       - **Measurement scores** (e.g., \"MRC 40/60\", \"CPAx 22/50\") which are important for evaluating rehabilitation progress.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Emotion Analysis**\n",
        "   - **Value:** `{ 'surprise': 0.376, 'sadness': 0.302, 'fear': 0.123, 'anger': 0.100, 'joy': 0.097 }`\n",
        "   - **Explanation:**\n",
        "     - This provides a breakdown of emotions expressed in the text.\n",
        "     - The highest emotion score is for \"Surprise\" (37.6%) and \"Sadness\" (30.2%), indicating a mix of emotional responses related to the patient’s struggle and slow recovery.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. **Subjectivity**\n",
        "   - **Value:** `0.493`\n",
        "   - **Explanation:**\n",
        "     - Measures how subjective (opinion-based) or objective (fact-based) the text is.\n",
        "     - A value near 0.5 suggests a balanced mix of objective medical details and subjective descriptions of the patient’s experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. **Polarity**\n",
        "   - **Value:** `0.0386`\n",
        "   - **Explanation:**\n",
        "     - Indicates the sentiment polarity on a scale from `-1` (negative) to `1` (positive).\n",
        "     - A near-zero value suggests a neutral tone, which is typical for medical reports where factual descriptions are emphasized.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. **Lexical Diversity**\n",
        "   - **Value:** `0.649`\n",
        "   - **Explanation:**\n",
        "     - Measures the variety of vocabulary used in the text.\n",
        "     - A higher score indicates more diverse vocabulary, which helps assess the complexity of medical documentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 9. **Readability Score**\n",
        "   - **Value:** `12.6`\n",
        "   - **Explanation:**\n",
        "     - This score is based on the Flesch-Kincaid readability test, which estimates the educational level required to understand the text.\n",
        "     - A score of `12.6` means the content is understandable by someone with at least a high school education, which is expected for medical professionals reading ICU reports.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why This Analysis is Important\n",
        "- **Medical Decision Making:** Helps healthcare providers understand the emotional and cognitive impact of a patient’s condition.\n",
        "- **Patient Monitoring:** Tracks the evolution of patient communication and engagement.\n",
        "- **Clinical Documentation:** Ensures the text is clear, factual, and appropriately complex for medical professionals.\n",
        "- **Emotional and Psychological Insights:** Provides a way to assess patient morale and engagement, crucial for long-term recovery.\n"
